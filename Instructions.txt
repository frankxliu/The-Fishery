Hello my fellow fisherman! You've been hired
to work at Frankie's Fishery your training
spans across multiple days. You are required 
to catch all the fish in that day to proceed
to the next. Use side arrow keys to move
your boat left and right, and use down arrow
key to extend your fishing rod. But it 
doesn't end there! The fish are nasty lil
buggers so you'll have to match the fish's 
movement by clicking your mouse. It ain't 
easy I tell ya, good luck young chap!
